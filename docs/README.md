## Introduction
**Hey! It's a package manager for ZSH! (And it's a bunch of other stuff too)**

Managing your ZSH configuration can be tedious, thankless toil. Solutions like Oh My Zsh address this problem admirably, but *you still have to spend time messsing around with configuration files!* ZConfer abstracts away the task of configuration behind its elegant and easy command line interface, so you can get back to focusing on what actually matters.

* ZConfer is a comprehensive plugin manager capable of adding, deleting, enabling, and disabling plugins.
* ZConfer can download new themes and enable them
* ZConfer breaks your PATH into individual "segments", which can then be managed individually. ZConfer can also add new segments.
* ZConfer is an alias manager capable of adding, removing, and changing aliases.

## Demo
*Installing Z, a plugin for quickly jumping to previously visited directories*:
